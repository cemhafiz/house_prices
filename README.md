This project is a valuable exercise for machine learning.
The main goal here is predicting house prices by preprocessing the data and creating a model and training it for testing.
Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Regression, kNN Regressor and Decision Tree Regression algorithms are used.
